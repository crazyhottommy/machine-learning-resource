* [Deep learning applications in single-cell omics data analysis](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.26.470166v1) " Through a systematic literature review, we have found that DL has not yet revolutionized or addressed the most pressing challenges of the SC omics field. However, using DL models for single-cell omics has shown promising results (in many cases outperforming the previous state-of-the-art models) but lacking the needed biological interpretability in many cases."
